## The Legal Landscape: Is OLP Legal in the Philippines?

Yes â€” but **only if the OLP is registered and compliant with local laws**.

The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** regulates online lenders in the Philippines. Hereâ€™s what makes an OLP **legal**:

1. **SEC Registration**  
   OLPs must be registered as a lending company with a valid **Certificate of Authority (CA)**.

2. **Data Privacy Compliance**  
   Must adhere to **RA 10173 (Data Privacy Act)**, ensuring borrower data is protected.

3. **Fair Collection Practices**  
   The **SEC Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2019**, prohibits harassment and public shaming.

ğŸ’² **Important Note:** Many apps are available on the Play Store, but that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re legal. Always check with the [SECâ€™s official list of registered online lending platforms](https://www.sec.gov.ph/lending-companies-and-financing-companies-2/list-of-financing-companies/) before applying.
